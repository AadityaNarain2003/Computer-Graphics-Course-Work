QUESTION 1:
    I made two changes for the same, both of these combined did reduce the work on the system and made it more precise and accurate
    1. The first being the simple change from float to double, which reduced floating point error by a lot and it helped to increase the 
    radius till where the problem won't arise. This isn't a complete fix but a temporary one. This helped increase the radius.
    2. The second change that i did was to bring the origin to the camera. Therefore changing the to, from vectors and changing the vertices according to the new origin
